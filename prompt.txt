John: So, um, I've been thinking about the project, you know, and I believe we need to, uh, make some changes. I mean, we want the project to succeed, right? So, like, I think we should consider maybe revising the timeline.
Sarah: I totally agree, John. I mean, we have to be realistic, you know. The timeline is, like, too tight. You know what I mean? We should definitely extend it.
